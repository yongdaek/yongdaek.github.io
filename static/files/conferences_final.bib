 impact = {At the time, only South Korea and the United States had widely deployed Voice over LTE (VoLTE) technology, so no other countries were affected. The vulnerabilities were jointly disclosed with the the US Cyber Emergency Response Team (US Cert) as VU\#943167. At the time, none of the US operators acknowledged the vulnerabilities, but they later patched them silently. After this investigation, we received funding from SK Telecom to start investigating security of LTE networks. We were invited to make a presentation at GSMA, the organization of the operators. The findings were covered by multiple media outlets, such as IT World, Nexus Security Bulletin, DSLReports, Softpedia, tom's guide, Pocketnow, FierceMobileIT, Techworm, Neowin, and Network World.},

Apple: CVE-2024-27870 -- equivalent to CVE-2025-21477 in Qualcomm modems. itemize LLFuzz revealed systemic flaws in how lower-layer baseband logic is implemented across vendors. In one test, a single malformed MAC-layer packet immediately disabled a device during data streaming. These results demonstrate that lower layers remain a blind spot in mobile security.

 impact = {The initial response from GSMA was disappointing as they viewed this work as only academically interesting. However, it turned out to be important for both academia and standard bodies. After it was initially discussed in 2019 Reno 97th 3GPP meeting (S3-194063), a lot of documents (and probably discussions) tried to address this attack accross multiple 3GPP meetings: TSGS3\_100Bis-e (S3-202556, S3-202738, S3-202740), TSGS3\_100e (S3-202026, S3-202109, S3-202150), TSGS3\_101e (S3-202983, S3-202984, S3-203158, S3-203160, S3-203364, S3-203447), TSGS3\_102Bis-e (S3-211345), TSGS3\_102e (S3-210131, S3-210778, S3-210783), TSGS3\_103e (S3-212351), TSGS3\_104e (S3-212748, S3-213244), TSGS3\_105e (S3-214408), and TSGS3\_107e (S3-221266). In addition, the attack is extended to sigover attack over unicast channel by us~bae2022watching, layer 2 messages by Tan et. al.~tan2021data and uplink channel by Erni et. al.~erni2022adaptover. In 5G, SA3 failed to secure these unauthenticated channels due to various technical problems. I hope to solve these problems before 6G design is complete, which will start in 2 years.},
