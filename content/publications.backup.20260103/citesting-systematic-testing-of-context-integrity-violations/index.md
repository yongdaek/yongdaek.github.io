## Impact

We uncovered 29, 22, 16, and 59 distinct CIVs in Open5GS, srsRAN, Amarisoft, and Nokia LTE cores, respectively. These allow remote detachment, IMSI exposure, and presence detection without requiring proximity. We contributed patches to Open5GS and Amarisoft. CITesting will be released as an open-source tool to support future uplink security research.
