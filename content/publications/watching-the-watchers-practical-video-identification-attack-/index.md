## Impact

Although it is too early to determine the impact of the video identification work, it was discussed in 2022 August 3GPP meeting (S3-221922). We plan to exploit information leakage in the uplink scheduling. If we can identify a victim's uplink signal, an attacker may use this information to find a physical location of the victim, by combining with a directional antenna. We received funding from Korean police to find the physical location of the SIM Boxes used for voice phishing.
